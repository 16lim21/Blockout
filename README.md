# Project Ideas
1. Calendar manager called "block out". I like my calendars filled with things so I know what to do next, but I also don't want it to cluttered. Would fill in free blocks with work that needs to be done. Can even be used to plan non-work events. So the goal is to literally "block out" your calendar. Sync with google calendar instead of making/managing my own calendar application?

Kind of an open-source version of this: https://reclaim.ai/ (implement more features than they do since there are some I would want to have that they don't)

2. App that aggregates messages from all your messaging apps (facebook messenger, slack, discord, gitter, groupme, google hangouts etc.)

3. A better culpa? Could take model of glassdoor where you have to submit a review (maybe like once a year) in order to view the reviews (since culpa has problem with not enough reviews). Maybe make a section for just freshman/entry classes so that people who are new can still see some reviews without having submitted any.

4. Some note taking app
